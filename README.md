## 2. Overview

This project implements a machine learning model to predict the probability of a user clicking on an advertisement based on features, specifically age and estimated salary. Utilizing the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, the model is optimized through hyperparameter tuning to enhance predictive performance and accuracy.

## 3. Motivation

The digital advertising industry is experiencing exponential growth, with global digital ad spend projected to reach $517.51 billion by 2023, representing a substantial portion of total media ad spend. Despite this growth, the challenge of effectively targeting advertisements to maximize engagement remains critical for businesses seeking to optimize their return on investment (ROI).

Studies indicate that personalized advertising can increase click-through rates (CTR) by as much as 10 times compared to non-targeted ads. However, accurately predicting which users are likely to engage with an advertisement poses a significant challenge. This project addresses this gap by leveraging machine learning techniques to enhance ad targeting precision.
  
In summary, this project is motivated by the need to improve ad targeting efficacy in a rapidly growing market, leveraging advanced machine learning techniques to deliver actionable insights and drive business performance.

## 4. Business Use Cases

1. **Targeted Advertising Campaigns:** Enhance the effectiveness of digital advertising campaigns by targeting users who are more likely to click on ads, leading to higher engagement and conversion rates.
2. **Customer Segmentation:** Segment users based on predicted ad-click behavior, allowing businesses to tailor marketing strategies to different customer groups and optimize ad spend.
3. **Ad Spend Optimization:** Allocate advertising budgets more efficiently by focusing on demographics with higher predicted click-through rates, thereby maximizing ROI.
4. **E-commerce Recommendations:** Integrate ad click predictions into recommendation systems to suggest relevant products and promotions to users, increasing sales and customer engagement.
5. **Lead Scoring:** Improve lead scoring models by incorporating ad click predictions, allowing sales teams to prioritize leads with higher engagement potential.

## 6. Model Used

This project implements a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model with K=9, optimized using a KD-tree, to predict customers who will click on displayed online ads. The KD-tree, an efficient data structure, accelerates the search for nearest neighbors, making the model suitable for large datasets. Trained on a dataset containing user demographics (age and salary) and their click behavior on online ads, the model identifies the 9 nearest neighbors for each user to determine their likelihood of clicking an ad.
